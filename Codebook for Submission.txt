The tidied data frame contains the data from test and training sets, each of which has been summarized over the 561 dimensions to generate mean and standard deviation.\
\
The dataset has been organized into the following columns:\
1. Subject ID: The number denoting the subject, ranging 1-30\
2. ActivityID: The specific activity for which data was collected. The ID (string was established based on the \'91activity_labels.txt\'92 file supplied with original data set. It can take one of 6 levels.\
3. Datatype: Whether data is from the training set or the test set\
4. Dimensions of the data originally collected. As the dimensions are unknown, they have been labeled Dim.1\'85 Dim.561. For each dimension, data has been summarized into the mean (\'91mean\'92) and standard deviation (\'91SD\'92). Thus, a column Dim.1_mean denotes the average, while Dim.1_SD denotes the deviation. \
